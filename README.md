## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on a layoffs dataset. The analysis was performed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the data.

## Data Cleaning Process

1. **Removing Duplicates:** Ensured that all duplicate entries were eliminated.
2. **Standardizing Data:** Standardized formats and filled in missing values where appropriate.
3. **Handling Missing Values:** Inspected and deleted rows with significant missing information.
4. **Removing Unnecessary Columns/Rows:** Dropped any columns and rows that were not relevant to the analysis.
